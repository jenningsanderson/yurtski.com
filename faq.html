<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h4 class="faq-section toggle-child-on-click">Where are the yurts located?</h4>
<p class='faq-expand mb24'>The yurts sit nestled high in the Southern Swan Mountains of Montana, in between the Mission Mountains and the Bob Marshall Wilderness. They are situated deep in the Montana backcountry, approximately eleven miles via snowmachine or eight miles skinning from the trailhead. The trailhead is approximately an hour from Missoula and 90 minutes from Helena.<br>
<br>
The trailhead is located on Cottonwood Lakes road at the winter plowing boundary just past Rich's Montana Guest Ranch. The trailhead has limited parking so please consider carpooling.<br>
<br>
<a href="maps.html">See our maps page for more information</a>.</p>


<h4 class="faq-section toggle-child-on-click">What is the difference between the Lupine Yurt and the Alpine Yurt?</h4>
<p class='faq-expand'>About two hundred vertical feet and ¾ mile separate the two yurts. Both yurts are similarly equipped. The Lupine maybe better suited for skiing off the Lookout/ Supernatural Area of the horseshoe where as the Alpine is slightly better situated for skiing the back bowls. The Alpine Yurt is slightly larger and can more easily accommodate bigger groups.</p>

<h4 class="faq-section toggle-child-on-click">What is the elevation of the yurts?</h4>
<p class='faq-expand'>The Alpine Yurt sits at approximately 6800’ and the Lupine yurt sits at approximately 6600’</p>

<h4 class="faq-section toggle-child-on-click">How much snow do the yurts receive each season?</h4>
<p class='faq-expand'>The Seeley-Swan area of Montana is known for its colder weather and heavier snow falls. This translates to incredible cold smoke powder skiing. On April 1st of 2009, we had almost 14 feet of snow pack, not fall at the Alpine Yurt. The average seems to be around 10 feet. Storms dumping multiple feet of snow are not uncommon.</p>

<h4 class="faq-section toggle-child-on-click">What is a gear haul?</h4>
<p class='faq-expand'>Take the weight off your back and off your mind. YurtSki will haul your group’s gear to the door of the yurt. Gear haul costs $350 per 6 people, each way.<br>
<br>
The trip into Yurt Ski is 11 miles on the road, or 8 miles if you cut the switchback and climb with skins.  A gear haul in makes the most of your trip by getting you and your stuff into the yurts so you can ski and enjoy!  We will also make sure to point out the freshwater spring, start you off with a full supply of water, and make sure the firewood is stocked and ready.</p>

<h4 class="faq-section toggle-child-on-click">Can we use our own snowmobiles and gear sleds to access the yurts?</h4> 
<p class='faq-expand'>Yes! We offer gear hauls as an add-on, but it is not required, and many groups like to do this on their own! Just know that sometimes it can be an "adventurous day" depending on what mother nature throws at you and your crew.</p>


<h4 class="faq-section toggle-child-on-click">Why are there daily minimums?</h4>
<p class='faq-expand'>The minimum allows us to ensure exclusivity to your group while staying at the yurts. We have different minimums for each yurt to accommodate different group sizes. Minimums are in dollars, not people. For example, groups of 2 or 3 are more than welcome to rent out the Lupine Yurt on a weekend night, they will just be paying the price of a 4 person group. Additionally, due to the terrain at the yurts, we require all parties to be at least 2 people for avalanche safety.</p>

<h4 class="faq-section toggle-child-on-click">How many people can stay in the yurts?</h4>
<p class='faq-expand'>Both yurts have 2 full-size bunk beds allowing for individual sleeping for 4 people or 8 if sharing the full-size mattresses. Additionally, the slightly larger Alpine Yurt has 2 futon couches that can be converted into beds.</p>

<h4 class="faq-section toggle-child-on-click">What type of terrain is in the area?</h4>
<p class='faq-expand'>The immediate Yurtski terrain consists of a horseshoe shaped ridge that is separated into three main bowls by short finger ramps. The skiing in these areas ranges from steep cliff sections and chutes to mellow burnt tree runs which funnel back towards the yurts. There is also ample opportunity to tour the ridge and drop off the backside towards the Bob Marshall & Scapegoat Wilderness. Longer tours may decide to drop off the backside to a lake for lunch and laps.</p>

<h4 class="faq-section toggle-child-on-click">How do I book a trip?</h4>
<p>View the <a href="book.html">availability calendar here</a>! Check both the Alpine and Lupine availability and grab the weekend you want! Always feel free to call or email us and we can help you with your booking! Upon completion of your reservation, We'll email you all the details you need to know for your upcoming trip.</p>

<h4 class="faq-section toggle-child-on-click">Do we need to have avalanche equipment even if we’re not skiing?</h4>
<p class='faq-expand'>Yes. A beacon, shovel and probe are mandatory for anyone visiting the yurts. The Swan Mountains are avalanche country and we must be prepared at all times. Avalanches can and do occur in the area.</p>

<h4 class="faq-section toggle-child-on-click">What time is check-in/checkout?</h4>
<p class='faq-expand'><strong>12pm</strong>. Please ensure that the yurt is cleaned, you have disinfected all surfaces, and your stuff is out by noon. If you're headed skiing before heading back to your car (you should!), please stash your gear outside and out of the way of any incoming guests who may arrive while you're getting those last minute turns.</p>

<h4 class="faq-section toggle-child-on-click">Are cross-country skis or snowshoes okay?</h4>
<p class='faq-expand'>Cross-country skis are not recommended. There is A LOT of snow. Snowshoes seem to work for some snowboarders, but we do recommend split-boarding over snowshoe approaches for our snowboarding friends.</p>

<h4 class="faq-section toggle-child-on-click">What do you do for water?</h4>
<p class='faq-expand'>We utilize a mountain spring for drinking water. Drinking water can be retrieved on the way into the yurts. With gear hauls, we will gather at least 5 gallons of water for your group. If not using gear haul, water jugs are recommended, as is a hatchet to break the ice that forms over the spring. We drink from the spring untreated; however this decision is ultimately yours. Boiling or treating water with iodine are good options. Otherwise, culinary/ washing water is gained from melting snow.</p>

<h4 class="faq-section toggle-child-on-click">How do you heat the yurts?</h4>
<p class='faq-expand'>The yurts are heated by wood burning stoves and all firewood is provided. Inside the yurts there are wood bunks full of dry, split wood. Outside the yurts there are woodpiles where rounds can be found for splitting.</p>

<h4 class="faq-section toggle-child-on-click">What do I need to bring?</h4>
<p class='faq-expand'><a class="link" href="packing">Click here to see our suggested packing list.</a></p>

<h4 class="faq-section toggle-child-on-click">Can I bring my dog?</h4>
<p class='faq-expand'>No. We ask you to please leave your four-legged friends at home when going to YurtSki. We are concerned about sanitation of the yurts. Also, the long snowmobile approach is extremely hard on dogs. We highly recommend <a target="_blank" href="http://www.skyhikennel.com/">SkyHi Kennel</a> if you'd like to board the pup while you're out skiing, it's where we send our furry friends.</p>

<h4 class="faq-section toggle-child-on-click">Where can I rent backcountry skiing equipment in Missoula or Bozeman?</h4>
<div>
	<p style="padding-left:5px;"><strong>Missoula: </strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://mtskitech.com/">MT Ski Tech</a>: Skis, boots, beacon, shovel, and probe @ $229 for a four day trip when you mention YurtSki.<br>

</div>


<h4 class="faq-section toggle-child-on-click">What is supplied at the yurts?</h4>

<h4 class="faq-section toggle-child-on-click">Is there an outhouse?</h4>
<p>There is a three sided outhouse located directly behind each yurt in order to answer nature’s call in relative comfort.</p>

<h4 class="faq-section toggle-child-on-click">Where is the closest place to stay before my trip?</h4>
<div>
	<p>While there are plenty of lodging options in Helena or Missoula, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://richranch.com">Rich's Montana Guest Ranch</a> offers cabin rooms for rent. They are located a quarter-mile from the trailhead and their winter rates are:</p>

	<div class="align-center mt12 px36 mb24">
		<table class="table">
			<tr>
				<th>Small Cabin Room</th>
				<td>1 King Bed</td>
				<td>$125 per night (plus tax)</td>
			</tr>
			</tr>
				<th>Large Cabin Room</th>
				<td>2 Queen Beds</td>
				<td>$150 per night (plus tax)</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</div>
</div>

<h4 class="faq-section toggle-child-on-click">What about the burn?</h4>
<p>The summer 2017 forest fires opened up terrain never really considered before! There are now incredible open tree runs right out the front door of the yurt down into the gulley. If you liked skiing the classic "burnt trees" before, you're in for a treat!</p>



<h4 class="faq-section toggle-child-on-click">What is the Cancellation Policy?</h4>
