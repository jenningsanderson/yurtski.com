# Come seek refuge at YurtSki this winter!

<p class="pt6 txt-m txt-em">Unforgettable Montana backcountry lodging & skiing experience.</p>

At Yurtski we pride ourselves in providing unforgettable backcountry skiing experiences. Our goal is for people to enjoy the beauty of the Swan Range safely and in comfort while getting some incredible powder turns.

Our yurts lie deep in the Montana backcountry and offer unparalleled access to some of Montana’s best powder skiing. Our immediate terrain is situated off a large horseshoe shaped ridge with finger ramps that separate the area into three main bowls which funnel back down to the yurts. The skiing ranges from mellow glades to steep wide open bowls. The area offers exceptional views of the Missions, Swans, and the Bob Marshall/Scapegoat Wilderness and has endless potential.

So get a group together and come on up to Yurtski for an experience that will last a life time!
