### Where are the yurts located?
The yurts sit nestled high in the Southern Swan Mountains of Montana, in between the Mission Mountains and the Bob Marshall Wilderness. They are situated deep in the Montana backcountry, approximately eleven miles via snowmachine or eight miles skinning from the trailhead. The trailhead is approximately an hour from Missoula, Montana.

The trailhead is located on Cottonwood Lakes road at the winter plowing boundary just past Rich's Montana Guest Ranch. The trailhead has limited parking so please consider carpooling.


### What is the difference between the Lupine Yurt and the Alpine Yurt?

About two hundred vertical feet and ¾ mile separate the two yurts. Both yurts are similarly equipped. The Lupine maybe better suited for skiing off the Lookout/ Supernatural Area of the horseshoe where as the Alpine is slightly better situated for skiing the back bowls.

### What is the elevation of the yurts?
The Alpine Yurt sits at approximately 6800’ and the Lupine yurt sits at approximately 6600’

### How much snow do the yurts receive each season?
The Seeley-Swan area of Montana is known for its colder weather and heavier snow falls. This translates to incredible cold smoke powder skiing. On April 1st of 2009, we had almost 14 feet of snow pack, not fall at the Alpine Yurt. The average seems to be around 10 feet. Storms dumping multiple feet of snow are not uncommon.

### What is a gear haul?
Take the weight of your back and off your mind. Yurtski will haul your group’s gear to the door of the yurt. We’ll take in your food, and personal gear while you hike with only a day/avy bag. Loads are limited to 40 lbs per person. A gear haul is not a people haul.

### Why is there a person minimum?
The minimum allows us to ensure exclusivity to your group while staying at the yurts.

### How many people can stay in the yurts?
There is sleeping for up to eight people in each yurt. Sleeping arrangements include mattresses, 4-inch sleeping pads, cots, futon and pull out single. These differences allow for a variety of sleeping combinations.

### How far is the skin into the Yurts?
From the trailhead to the Alpine Yurt it is an eleven-mile trip via a sled trail. The first five miles being flat. Skiers can take a cut off near the lakes, which reduces the skin to the Alpine Yurt to approximately eight miles. The Lupine Yurt lies approximately ¾ mile and 200’ below the Alpine Yurt.

### What type of terrain is in the area?
The immediate Yurtski terrain consists of a horseshoe shaped ridge that is separated into three main bowls by short finger ramps. The skiing in these areas ranges from steep cliff sections and chutes to mellow burnt tree runs which funnel back towards the yurts. There is also ample opportunity to tour the ridge and drop off the backside towards the Bob Marshall & Scapegoat Wilderness. Longer tours may decide to drop off the backside to a lake for lunch and laps.

### How do I book a trip?
There are Book now buttons on every page of our website.  These buttons direct you to our booking service where you can do everything online! Upon completion of your reservation, We'll email you all the details you need to know for your upcoming trip. 

### Do we need to have avalanche equipment even if we’re not skiing?
Yes. A beacon, shovel and probe are mandatory for anyone visiting the yurts. The Swan Mountains are avalanche country and need to be treated with respect. Avalanches can and do occur in the area.

### Can I snowboard at the yurt?
Absolutely! Split boards have made great strides in recent years and work quite well. Otherwise, a traditional snowboard combined with snowshoes or approach skis are an enjoyable way to enjoy the backcountry.

### Are cross-country skis or snowshoes okay?
Cross-country skis are not recommended. There is A LOT of snow. Snowshoes seem to work for some snowboarders.

### Can I snowmobile into the yurts?
Yes, though beware of two large side hill drifts that form and require careful navigation and experience. No one wants their gear to spill down the hill. No highmarking.

### What do you do for water?
We utilize a mountain spring for drinking water. Drinking water can be retrieved on the way into the yurts and with gear hauls we will gather at least 5 gallons of water for your group. If your group is self sufficient, water jugs are recommended, as is a hatchet to break the ice that forms over the spring. We drink from the spring untreated; however this decision is ultimately yours. Boiling or treating water with iodine are good options. Otherwise, culinary/ washing water is gained from melting snow.

### Are the yurts heated?
The yurts are heated by wood burning stoves and all firewood is provided. Inside the yurts there are wood bunks full of dry, split wood. Outside the yurts there are woodpiles where rounds can be found for splitting.
