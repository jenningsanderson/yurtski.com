### Where do we go?
Before your trip, we will send you an email with the following information:
- When and where to meet for the gear haul (if applicable).
- Maps with clearly marked directions to the yurts.
- Instructions to download and install interactive maps of the area to your smartphone (these will work offline).

### Cell Phones
There is spotty cell reception at the Yurt and along the ridge. Do not rely on having reception for navigation or general communication with your group. Do bring your cell phone and know that you can get a message out in the event of an emergency, especially from the ridge.

### Packing for the Gear Haul + Tow
While our gear hauling toboggans are big, so is gear and food for 4 - 8 people for a few days. Please pack as small as you can. Duffel bags and backpacks work best (No Suitcases!). Please bring a helmet for the snowmobile tow.

#### How much beer?
Cans are known to bounce, bump, and explode in a fully loaded gear sled over 11 miles. Large groups planning on bringing ~ 80 cans of beer should consider purchasing a pony keg.
