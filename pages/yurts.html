<h4 class="txt-h4 border-b">Getting to the Yurts</h4>
<p class="pt6">The ski into the yurts is 8 miles and 1,500 ft. Additionally, there is an 11 mile snowmobile approach. If you opt for our gear haul + tow service, we will haul your gear <strong>all the way to the yurt</strong> and tow your party across all but 1.5 miles of the 8 mile ski.</p>

		<p>The Seeley-Swan area of Montana is known for its colder weather and heavier snow falls. This translates to incredible cold smoke powder skiing. Storms dumping multiple feet of snow are not uncommon.  The immediate Yurtski terrain offers skiing that ranges from steep cliff sections and chutes to mellow burnt tree runs which funnel back towards the yurts. There is also ample opportunity to tour the ridge and drop off the backside towards the Bob Marshall & Scapegoat Wilderness to a lake for lunch and laps.</p>

<h4 class="txt-h4 border-b pt24">Life at the Yurts</h4>

<p class="pt6">The yurts feature wood stoves for heat and clotheslines and hooks to hang and dry your gear. Each yurt has a stocked wood pile and axes to keep the stove burning through the night.</p>

<p class="pt6">Each yurt is equipped with a well-stocked kitchen including pots+pans, kettles, (new!) knives, cutting boards, utensils, mugs, plates, and bowls for 8. There are three burner propane stoves and each yurt has a sink that filters to a greywater drain.

<p class="pt6">Drinking water can be retrieved on the way into the yurts from a mountain spring so that you don't have to melt snow. In order to answer nature’s call in comfort there is a three sided outhouse located directly behind each yurt. There is also a Life flight extraction kit (helicopter specific backboard, splints, neck braces, emergency blanket, six man carry, basic first aid, rescue toboggan).</p>
