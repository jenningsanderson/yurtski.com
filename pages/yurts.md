The yurts sit nestled high in the Southern Swan Mountains of Montana, in between the Mission Mountains and the Bob Marshall Wilderness with a trailhead about an hour away from Missoula.
They are situated deep in the Montana backcountry, approximately eleven miles via snowmachine or eight miles skinning from the trailhead. The yurts are 20 feet in diameter and are built on elevated wood platforms. Each yurt has sleeping for up to eight people and a full kitchen with all the necessities to make even the most gourmet of meals. The yurts are heated by wood burning stoves and all firewood is provided. Our yurts will ensure a comfortable safe place to stay while enjoying Montana’s pristine backcountry. The Alpine Yurt sits at approximately 6800’ and the Lupine yurt sits at approximately 6600’.  About two hundred vertical feet and ¾ mile separate the two yurts.  The Alpine Yurt site also includes a heated 10 foot yurt for extra sleeping space for 2 people.

The Seeley-Swan area of Montana is known for its colder weather and heavier snow falls. This translates to incredible cold smoke powder skiing. Storms dumping multiple feet of snow are not uncommon.  The immediate Yurtski terrain offers skiing that ranges from steep cliff sections and chutes to mellow burnt tree runs which funnel back towards the yurts. There is also ample opportunity to tour the ridge and drop off the backside towards the Bob Marshall & Scapegoat Wilderness to a lake for lunch and laps.

Drinking water can be retrieved on the way into the yurts from a mountain spring. In order to answer nature’s call in comfort there is a three sided outhouse located directly behind each yurt. There is also a Life flight extraction kit (helicopter specific backboard, splints, neck braces, emergency blanket, six man carry, basic first aid, rescue toboggan)
