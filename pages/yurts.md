<p>The yurts sit nestled high in the Southern Swan Mountains of Montana, in between the Mission Mountains and the Bob Marshall Wilderness with a trailhead about an hour away from Missoula and 90 minutes from Helena.</p>

		<p>The Seeley-Swan area of Montana is known for its colder weather and heavier snow falls. This translates to incredible cold smoke powder skiing. Storms dumping multiple feet of snow are not uncommon.  The immediate Yurtski terrain offers skiing that ranges from steep cliff sections and chutes to mellow burnt tree runs which funnel back towards the yurts. There is also ample opportunity to tour the ridge and drop off the backside towards the Bob Marshall & Scapegoat Wilderness to a lake for lunch and laps.</p>

<p class="mt12">Drinking water can be retrieved on the way into the yurts from a mountain spring. In order to answer nature’s call in comfort there is a three sided outhouse located directly behind each yurt. There is also a Life flight extraction kit (helicopter specific backboard, splints, neck braces, emergency blanket, six man carry, basic first aid, rescue toboggan)</p>
